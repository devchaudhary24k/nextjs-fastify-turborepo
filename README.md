## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/devchaudhary24k/nextjs-fastify-turborepo.git
   cd nextjs-fastify-turborepo
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**  
   Copy the environment template and update the configuration for each application:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   > Repeat this step for every app within the monorepo. Edit the `.env` files with the required values.

4. **Start local services (Database & Redis)**  
   Make sure [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is running, then launch the database and cache services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Deployment

The recommended deployment strategy for this monorepo is as follows:

- **Next.js Application (`app`)**: Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), which offers seamless integration and optimized hosting for Next.js apps.
- **Astro Marketing Site (`web`)**: Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) for best static site performance and simple CI/CD from your GitHub repository.
- **Fastify Backend (`backend`)**: Deploy to [Render](https://render.com/) for fast, reliable Node.js API hosting with automatic deployments from your repository.

All of these platforms support direct integration with GitHub, enabling continuous deployment on every push to your `main` branch.

### Docker

Docker support is currently in progress and will be provided soon.
